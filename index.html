      <p>Holy Boulders was discovered in 2004 by Aaron Brouwer by viewing ariel photographs. the property was owned by the Tripp family. The Tripp family gave climbers verbal permission to climb. 8 years later the family decided they wanted to sell the land. in 2012 ICA started working on trying perserve the land and take ownership. The property was transferred in 2016 and is now open to climbers and has some of the best bouldering in the midwest.</p>

      <a name="LakeKincaid"> <h1>Lake Kincaid</h1> </a>
      <p>Lake kincaid is a lake in southern Illinois. There Happens to be a very big cliff coming out of the lake that provides the oppurtunity to Deep Water Solo. That is climbing with no protection due to being over the a deep body of water. you either have to hike or take a boat for Kinkaid climbing. The climbs are not beginner friendly. 5.10b is the easiet climb. Most are 5.12 or higher. You will need a floatie and towels. My favorite climbing spot near st louis.</p>
