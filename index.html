      <a name="LakeKincaid"> <h1>Lake Kincaid</h1> </a>
      <p>Lake kincaid is a lake in southern Illinois. There Happens to be a very big cliff coming out of the lake that provides the oppurtunity to Deep Water Solo. That is climbing with no protection due to being over the a deep body of water. you either have to hike or take a boat for Kinkaid climbing. The climbs are not beginner friendly. 5.10b is the easiet climb. Most are 5.12 or higher. You will need a floatie and towels. My favorite climbing spot near st louis.</p>
