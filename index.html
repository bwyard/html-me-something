      <h1>Elephant Rock</h1>
      <p>Elephant's rock is located about an hour and half away from St. Louis. The rocks are all granite, leading to a unique climbing experience in Missouri.
        It is primarily bouldering.Roped climbing is prohibited from the park.

    <p>Robinson Bluff is located in cadet, MO, just south of st. Louis. It is fairly new for climbing. The climbs are said to be developed for climbers by climbers.

      <a name="LakeKincaid"> <h1>Lake Kincaid</h1> </a>
      <p>Lake kincaid is a lake in southern Illinois. There Happens to be a very big cliff coming out of the lake that provides the oppurtunity to Deep Water Solo. That is climbing with no protection due to being over the a deep body of water. you either have to hike or take a boat for Kinkaid climbing. The climbs are not beginner friendly. 5.10b is the easiet climb. Most are 5.12 or higher. You will need a floatie and towels. My favorite climbing spot near st louis.</p>
